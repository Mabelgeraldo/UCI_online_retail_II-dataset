# UCI_online_retail_II-dataset
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and understand customer behavior within an online retail dataset and develop a machine learning model for predicting customer churn
Specifically, the project aims to:

Customer Segmentation: Use unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as K-Means clustering, to segment customers based on their transaction history, including recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM). This segmentation will provide insights into different customer groups.

Churn Prediction: Build a machine learning classification model to predict customer churn. Churn refers to customers who are likely to discontinue their engagement with the online retail platform. The model will utilize features such as recency, frequency, and monetary metrics to make predictions.

Feature Analysis: Conduct feature analysis to identify the most critical factors influencing customer churn. This analysis will help in understanding which aspects of customer behavior have the most significant impact on whether a customer churns or not.

Project Scope:

The project will encompass the following key activities:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address any data quality issues. Additionally, feature engineering will be performed to create relevant variables, including the calculation of recency.

Customer Segmentation: Customers will be segmented into distinct clusters using K-Means clustering. The optimal number of clusters will be determined based on the Silhouette Score, and customers will be assigned to clusters based on their RFM attributes.

Churn Prediction Model: I will develop a machine learning model, specifically employing a Random Forest Classifier, to forecast customer churn. This model will use RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features as input and binary labels (indicating churned or not churned) as the target variable.

Feature Importance Analysis: Feature importance analysis will be conducted to identify which customer attributes have the most significant influence on churn prediction. This analysis will prioritize features based on their importance scores.

Model Evaluation: I will assess the classification model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, I will calculate the generalization error on the test set to gauge the model's robustness
